This repo is populated with shapes from [CSS Battles](https://cssbattle.dev/) I have just discovered.  
My goal is to get 100% match and I do not focus at all on the least amount of characters used. I don't want to get into bad habits :)  
I find this shape forming game a pleasent and funny way to start a coding day. [See demo version here](https://veelcheck.github.io/shapes/).
