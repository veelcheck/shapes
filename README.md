This repo is populated with shapes from [CSS Battles](https://cssbattle.dev/) I have just discovered.  
My goal is to get 100% match and I do not focus at all on the least amount of characters used. I don't want to get into bad habits :blush:    
I find this shape forming game a pleasent and funny way to start a coding day.  

[See demo version here](https://veelcheck.github.io/shapes/).  
:exclamation: If you want to view it on your mobile device be sure your srceen is at least 400px wide.
